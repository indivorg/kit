standard [Theme Specification][].

**documentation**: https://indivorg.github.io/kit

---

Built for designs systems, white-labels, themes and other applications
where colors, typography, and layout are treated as first-class citizens
and based on a standard [Theme Specification][].

- Uses [Theme UI][]
- No hard-coded colours / branding â€“ not too opinionated.
- Used by Indiv in production.

## Getting Started

```sh
yarn add @indivorg/kit
```

Any styles in your app can reference values from the global `theme` object. To
provide the theme in context, wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider`
component and pass in a custom `theme` object.

```jsx
// basic usage
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import theme from './theme'

export default (props) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
)
```
